# Arduino-Sketches
- Switch branches to change sketches.
    - The `master` branch contains a template to start other sketches.
- Some sketches may require third party libraries to be installed with Arduino Studio.
- All sketches can use [these](https://github.com/thomasnorris/Arduino-Helpers) custom classes, if needed.
